## Partially Documented

These labs and projects all have docstrings, but no website designated to them. I worked on them individually unless specified.

### Academic

- [Smart Fan](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/MCC/Fan%20Simulation) - A simulated smart fan on a small microcontroller called the Dragon 12 light kit, which uses Assembly and C as coding languages. The main features the smart fan provides are variable speed, timer based shut off, temperature-based activation and shut off, and directional adjustment. Here's a demo [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Xgyfbko8Xa59LnwpV4MN3cyr_fQQYYQ/view) showcasing the fan's abilities and operation instructions.

#### Java

- [Jam and Tilt](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/project-2-jam-and-tilt-tribunes) - A project worked on with [YKhalitov](https://github.com/YKhalitov), where he worked on Tilt, and I worked on Jam. There was no starter code for this project, it was completely made from scratch. This project utlized a breadth first search algorithm, which I completed to determine the best way to solve the puzzle in the least number of steps. The two games both contain a text, and gui based UI. The goal of this version of Jam is to move the red car to the far right column to win the game. Here's a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bb9oAsAbfAwMRRKLx8F7Kcu8kPRrLe7I/view?usp=share_link) showcasing the main GUI of Jam.

- [Magnets](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab7) - A lab which solves a magnet puzzle using backtracking.

- [RIT Compression](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab6) - A lab which allows the compression and decompression of files in the raw or rit file format.

- [Parking Office](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab5) - A lab which simulates a parking office who can give tickets to cars parked in the wrong locations.

- [Toyland](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab4) - A lab implimenting Java's Classes and Interfaces to demonstrate toy genetics.

#### Python

- [Average-Reads](https://github.com/ian1dunn/average-reads) - A database management system to keep track of books, authors, publishers, editors, book ratings, read times, users, user book collections, user friends, and user statistics. This database management system was previously connected to a live RIT PostgreSQL server. It was developed with 4 other individuals. I created the UI, UI - database interaction, setup the database, and managed the SQL queries.

- [Movies](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/project-1-movies-theeman05) - A project which works with datasets from the [IMDB website](https://www.imdb.com/). This project gives experience reading in the data into various structures and collections in Python to store, organize and efficiently query for different kinds of information relating to the movies and their ratings.

- [Battle of the Bands](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab3) - A lab which uses quickselect (k-select) to locate the median element in a large list of bands and band rankings, as well as the time it took for the search. 

- [Fractal Antenna](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab2) - A lab which uses Python's turtle package to draw [fractal antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_antenna).

- [Secret Messages](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab1) - A lab allowing the option to encrypt or decrypt messages sent with a given key.

### Other

- [Crazy Dice](https://www.roblox.com/games/4767037485) - A tower defense game created on Roblox.
