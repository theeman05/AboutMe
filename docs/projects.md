## Partially Documented

These labs and projects all have docstrings, but no website designated to them. I worked on them individually unless specified.

### Academic

- [Smart Fan](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/MCC/Fan%20Simulation) - A simulated smart fan on a small microcontroller called the Dragon 12 light kit, which uses Assembly and C as coding languages. The main features the smart fan provides are variable speed, timer based shut off, temperature-based activation and shut off, and directional adjustment. There is a great [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Xgyfbko8Xa59LnwpV4MN3cyr_fQQYYQ/view) showcasing the fan's abilities and operation instructions.

#### Java

- [RIT Compression](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab6) - A lab which allows the compression and decompression of files in the raw or rit file format.

- [Parking Office](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab5) - A lab which simulates a parking office who can give tickets to cars parked in the wrong locations.

- [Toyland](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab4) - A lab implimenting Java's Classes and Interfaces to demonstrate toy genetics.

#### Python

- [Movies](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/project-1-movies-theeman05) - A project which works with datasets from the [IMDB website](https://www.imdb.com/). This project gives experience reading in the data into various structures and collections in Python to store, organize and efficiently query for different kinds of information relating to the movies and their ratings.

- [Battle of the Bands](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab3) - A lab which uses quickselect (k-select) to locate the median element in a large list of bands and band rankings, as well as the time it took for the search. 

- [Fractal Antenna](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab2) - A lab which uses Python's turtle package to draw [fractal antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_antenna).

- [Secret Messages](https://github.com/theeman05/School-Projects/tree/main/RIT/CSCI%20242/Lab1) - A lab allowing the option to encrypt or decrypt messages sent with a given key.
