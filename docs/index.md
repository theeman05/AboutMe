<center> Hello and welcome to my personal website built this to showcase important documents and introduce myself. </center>

## Overview
My name is Ethan Hartman, and I am currently a Junior at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/) pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. I began programming when I was about 13 years old and have loved it since. I have worked on [numerous projects](projects.md) in the past including games, research projects, and small programs, which I am quite proud of. Feel free to check those out and learn more about my coding style, and the function of those projects. When working on projects, I base them around the grand scheme, where all current actions will affect the future. Additionally, my favorite projects are those which have a positive impact or can be applied to benefit the future. I enjoy sharing my ideas with others and incorporating their feedback into projects. More recently, I've been searching for a Co-Op this summer (2023) involving software engineering, data structures, AI algorithms, or something else related to computer science. I’m not entirely sure which field of computer science I’d like to work in, so please [contact me](#contactme) with any questions.

## Background

Current activities I enjoy are hanging out with friends, hiking, playing games, programming, streaming, traveling, trying new foods, and visiting family. At the age of 20, in the summer of 2022, I travelled to Europe with two friends my age for a little over two weeks long. My hard years of work had finally paid off (literally towards funding the trip). I feel extremely lucky to do this as most never even leave the country, and I was able to at such a young age. It has really helped me realize how much I enjoy travelling and experiencing other cultures. 
In the past, I have played soccer, ran track, and swam. I played soccer for numerous years until I was about 12 years old, when my team separated. In eighth grade, I began swimming and continued it until I graduated from high school. While swimming in high school, I made sectionals all four years. In addition, I was nominated as swim team captain for 3 of those years.
