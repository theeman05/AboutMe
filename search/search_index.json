I began programming when I was about 13 years old and have loved it since. I have worked on numerous projects in the past including games, research projects, and small programs, which I am quite proud of. Feel free to check those out and learn more about my coding style, and the function of those projects. When working on projects, I base them around the grand scheme, where all current actions will affect the future. Additionally, my favorite projects are those which have a positive impact or can be applied to benefit the future. I enjoy sharing my ideas with others and incorporating their feedback into projects. More recently, I've been searching for a Co-Op this summer (2023) involving software engineering, data structures, AI algorithms, or something else related to computer science. I\u2019m not entirely sure which field of computer science I\u2019d like to work in, so please contact me with any questions. Background Current activities I enjoy are hanging out with friends, hiking, playing games, programming, streaming, traveling, trying new foods, and visiting family. At the age of 20, in the summer of 2022, I travelled to Europe with two friends my age for a little over two weeks long. My hard years of work had finally paid off (literally towards funding the trip). I feel extremely lucky to do this as most never even leave the country, and I was able to at such a young age. It has really helped me realize how much I enjoy travelling and experiencing other cultures. In the past, I have played soccer, ran track, and swam. I played soccer for numerous years until I was about 12 years old, when my team separated. In eighth grade, I began swimming and continued it until I graduated from high school. While swimming in high school, I made sectionals all four years. In addition, I was nominated as swim team captain for 3 of those years. Skills Programming Languages: Lua, Java, Python, C++, C#, C, SQL, .NET, HTML, CSS Development Software: Roblox Studio, IntelliJ, PyCharm, Microsoft Visual Studio (&Code), Unity Operating Systems: MS Windows, Android Other resources may be visited using the navigation panel to the left.

Partially Documented These labs and projects all have docstrings, but no website designated to them. I worked on them individually unless specified. Academic Smart Fan - A simulated smart fan on a small microcontroller called the Dragon 12 light kit, which uses Assembly and C as coding languages. The main features the smart fan provides are variable speed, timer based shut off, temperature-based activation and shut off, and directional adjustment. There is a great video showcasing the fan's abilities and operation instructions. Java Magnets - A lab which solves a magnet puzzle using backtracking. RIT Compression - A lab which allows the compression and decompression of files in the raw or rit file format. Parking Office - A lab which simulates a parking office who can give tickets to cars parked in the wrong locations. Toyland - A lab implimenting Java's Classes and Interfaces to demonstrate toy genetics. Python Movies - A project which works with datasets from the IMDB website . This project gives experience reading in the data into various structures and collections in Python to store, organize and efficiently query for different kinds of information relating to the movies and their ratings. Battle of the Bands - A lab which uses quickselect (k-select) to locate the median element in a large list of bands and band rankings, as well as the time it took for the search. Fractal Antenna - A lab which uses Python's turtle package to draw fractal antenna . Secret Messages - A lab allowing the option to encrypt or decrypt messages sent with a given key. Other Crazy Dice - A tower defense game created on Roblox.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#fully-documented","text":"","title":"Fully Documented"},{"location":"projects/#personal","text":"RedblackDbTree - A Red-black tree coded in Lua , which I have used in some of my private projects.","title":"Personal"},{"location":"projects/#partially-documented","text":"These labs and projects all have docstrings, but no website designated to them.
