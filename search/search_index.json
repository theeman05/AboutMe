Let's explore the possibilities and work together to make a meaningful impact in the world of computer science.</p> <p>Here's to the next adventure!</p>"},{"location":"#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an individual who values a well-rounded and enriching lifestyle. I find joy in a variety of activities, such as hanging out with friends, rock climbing, hiking, gaming, programming, streaming, traveling, trying new foods, and visiting family. These diverse interests not only contribute to my personal growth but also provide a balanced and dynamic perspective to my life.</p> <p>At the age of 20, during the summer of 2022, I embarked on a transformative journey to Europe with two friends. This immersive experience, spanning over two weeks, was a culmination of years of hard work and dedication, both personally and academically. The trip not only served as a reward but also deepened my appreciation for travel and the richness of experiencing different cultures. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have had such an opportunity at a young age, recognizing that many may never venture beyond their own borders.</p> <p>In 2023, I achieved a significant personal milestone by completing a challenging hike to the summit of New York's highest mountain, Mount Marcy. This accomplishment not only fueled my passion for outdoor adventures but also underscored the importance of perseverance and determination.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I am eagerly anticipating an upcoming trip to Peru in March 2024. This journey promises to be another chapter of exploration and cultural immersion, further adding to my repertoire of global experiences.</p> <p>In my earlier years, I was actively involved in sports, playing soccer for numerous years until the age of 12, when my team disbanded. Transitioning to eighth grade, I took up swimming, a passion that accompanied me through high school. Achieving a remarkable milestone, I made sectionals all four years and was honored to serve as the swim team captain for three of those years. These experiences not only instilled discipline and teamwork but also showcased my commitment to excellence both in and out of the water.</p> <p>As I continue to explore new avenues and embrace diverse experiences, I remain open to the ever-evolving tapestry of life, ready to weave in new threads of knowledge and adventure.</p>"},{"location":"#skills","title":"Skills","text":"<p>Programming Languages: Luau, Java, Python, SQL, TypeScript, Angular, C++, C#, C, PHP, JavaScript, HTML</p> <p>Development Software: Roblox Studio, IntelliJ, PyCharm, Microsoft Visual Studio and VS Code, Android Studio, Unity</p> <p>Development Tools: Git, GitHub, Trello</p> <p>Other resources may be visited using the navigation panel to the left. </p> <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p> <p>      ethan.h.hartman@gmail.com     Click to email  |         (585) 719-5247     Click to copy </p>"},{"location":"courses/","title":"Courses","text":"<p>The college courses I have completed, or plan on completing are listed below under their given category (some other classes may not be listed).</p>"},{"location":"courses/#in-progress-final-semester","title":"In-Progress (Final Semester)","text":"<ul> <li>CSCI 471: Professional Communications</li> <li>CSCI 344: Programming Language Concepts</li> <li>CSCI 335: Machine Learning</li> <li>CSCI 251: Concepts of Parallel and Distributed Systems</li> <li>STSO 120: Intro to Environmental Studies</li> <li>WINT 39: Rock Climb-Indoor Bouldering</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#completed","title":"Completed","text":""},{"location":"courses/#technological","title":"Technological","text":"<ul> <li>CSCI 431: Intro to Computer Vision</li> <li>CSCI 331: Intro to Artificial Intelligence</li> <li>CSCI 320: Principals of Data Management</li> <li>CSCI 262: Intro to Computer Science Theory</li> <li>CSCI 261: Analysis of Algorithms</li> <li>CSCI 250: Concepts of Computer Systems</li> <li>CSCI 243: The Mechanics of Programming</li> <li>CSCI 242: Computer Science for Transfer Students</li> <li>CSCI 141: Computer Science I</li> <li>SWEN 261: Intro to Software Engineering</li> <li>SWEN 123: Software Development and Problem Solving</li> <li>EEEE 346: Advanced Programming</li> <li>MATH 190: Discrete Math for Computing</li> <li>MCET 101: Fundamentals of Engineering</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#other","title":"Other","text":"<ul> <li>PHYS 212: University Physics II</li> <li>PHYS 207: University Physics I AP-C Waves</li> <li>PHYS 206: University Physics I: AP-C Mechanics</li> <li>MATH 251: Probability and Statistics</li> <li>MATH 241: Linear Algebra</li> <li>MATH 182A: Calculus II</li> <li>MATH 181: Project-Based Calculus I</li> <li>STSO 330: Energy and the Environment</li> <li>STSO 220: Environment and Society</li> <li>MLFR 151: Film, Comics, &amp; French Culture</li> <li>ENGL 150: Future of Writing</li> <li>UWRT 150: Writing Seminar</li> <li>COMM 142: Intro to Technical Communication</li> <li>IMGS 111: Imaging Science Fundamentals</li> <li>HIST 102: US Themes</li> <li>PHIL 102: Introduction to Moral Issues</li> <li>MEDG 101: Human Biology I</li> <li>WREC 72: Skiing / Snowboarding</li> </ul>"},{"location":"experience/","title":"Experience","text":""},{"location":"experience/#cvs-pharmacy","title":"CVS Pharmacy","text":""},{"location":"experience/#pharmacy-technician-november-2021-present","title":"Pharmacy Technician | November 2021 -
