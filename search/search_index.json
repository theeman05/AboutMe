I began programming when I was about 13 years old and have loved it since. I have worked on numerous projects in the past including games, research projects, and small programs, which I am quite proud of. Feel free to check those out and learn more about my coding style, and the function of those projects. When working on projects, I base them around the grand scheme, where all current actions will affect the future. Additionally, my favorite projects are those which have a positive impact or can be applied to benefit the future. I enjoy sharing my ideas with others and incorporating their feedback into projects. More recently, I've been searching for a Co-Op this summer (2023) involving software engineering, data structures, AI algorithms, or something else related to computer science. I'm not entirely sure which field of computer science I'd like to work in, so please contact me with any questions. </p>"},{"location":"#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Current activities I enjoy are hanging out with friends, rock climbing, hiking, gaming, programming, streaming, traveling, trying new foods, and visiting family. At the age of 20, in the summer of 2022, I travelled to Europe with two friends my age for a little over two weeks long. My hard years of work had finally paid off (literally towards funding the trip). I feel extremely lucky to do this as most never even leave the country, and I was able to at such a young age. It has really helped me realize how much I enjoy travelling and experiencing other cultures.  In the past, I played soccer, ran track, and swam. I played soccer for numerous years until I was about 12 years old, when my team separated. In eighth grade, I began swimming and continued it until I graduated from high school. While swimming in high school, I made sectionals all four years in addition to being nominated as swim team captain for 3 of those years. </p>"},{"location":"#skills","title":"Skills","text":"<p>Programming Languages: Lua, Java, Python, SQL, C++, C#, C, SQL, .NET, HTML, CSS</p> <p>Development Software: Roblox Studio, IntelliJ, PyCharm, Microsoft Visual Studio(&amp;Code), Unity, GitHub</p> <p>Operating Systems: MS Windows, Android</p> <p>Other resources may be visited using the navigation panel to the left. </p> <p>Thank you for visiting my website.</p> <p>      ethan.h.hartman@gmail.com     Click to email  |         (585) 719-5247     Click to copy </p>"},{"location":"courses/","title":"Courses","text":"<p>The college courses I have completed, or plan on completing are listed below under their given category (some other classes may not be listed).</p>"},{"location":"courses/#in-progress","title":"In-Progress","text":"<ul> <li>CSCI 261: ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS</li> <li>STSO 220: ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY</li> <li>CSCI 331: INTRO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</li> <li>CSCI 431: INTRO TO COMPUTER VISION</li> <li>SWEN 261: INTRO TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</li> <li>PHYS 207: UNIV PHYS I AP-C WAVES</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#completed","title":"Completed","text":""},{"location":"courses/#technological","title":"Technological","text":"<ul> <li>CSCI 262: Intro to Computer Science Theory</li> <li>CSCI 320: Principals of Data Management</li> <li>CSCI 141: Computer Science I</li> <li>CSCI 243: The Mechanics of Programming</li> <li>CSCI 250: Concepts of Computer Systems</li> <li>EEEE 346: Advanced Programming</li> <li>MATH 190: Discrete Math for Computing</li> <li>MCET 101: Fundamentals of Engineering</li> <li>SWEN 123: Software Development and Problem Solving</li> </ul>"},{"location":"courses/#other","title":"Other","text":"<ul> <li>MATH 251: Probability and Statistics</li> <li>MLFR 151: Film, Comics, &amp;
